# Folding

Folding is a way to display your rendered [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com) content on the web. See a [live demo here](http://hugowetterberg.github.io/folding).

I've implemented what was the most important features for me: folding, tag filtering and todo lists. Feel free to fork & send pull requests if you want additional features.
